# Project Skeleton Utilities
This repository provides a skeleton pytorch codebase commonly used across my projects. Some examples projects using this are [factored3d](https://github.com/shubhtuls/factored3d), [CMR](https://github.com/akanazawa/cmr/), [3D-relnet](https://github.com/nileshkulkarni/relative3d), and [CSM](https://nileshkulkarni.github.io/csm/).

Feel free to modify and/or build on this.
